# Week-3
Week 3 User Interface Projects
EasyManage is an application to track reporting requirements for sponsored projects at institutions of higher education. Week 3 will contain updates to the service endpoints and the user interface. The overall goal is to increase user functionality by adding comments and notifications as well as adding new fields to track user roles and award report status. The database/service endpoints will need to have new fields and documents added to them as well as corresponding api's designed.The user interface will need to be redesigned to increase navigation. The storyboard will need to reflect these changes as well.
