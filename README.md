# Week-3
Week 3 User Interface Projects
EasyManage is an application to track reporting requirements for sponsored projects at institutions of higher education. The user interface is important because it will provide users access to the database. The current user interface created in week 2 needs to be improved upon. The interface needs to be easier to navigate and more intuitive.
